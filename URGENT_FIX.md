# üö® URGENT: Fix OpenAI Integration on Netlify

## The Problem
Your site is using the fallback template reviews instead of OpenAI because the API key is not configured in Netlify.

## Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Add API Key to Netlify

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com
2. Select your site: **domes-reviews**
3. Go to: **Site configuration** ‚Üí **Environment variables**
4. Click **"Add a variable"**
5. Add:
   - **Key**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `[Use the API key from your .env file]`
6. Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Redeploy

After adding the environment variable:
1. Go to **Deploys** tab
2. Click **"Trigger deploy"** ‚Üí **"Deploy site"**
3. Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment

### Step 3: Test

1. Visit: https://domes-reviews.netlify.app/test-api.html
2. Click "Test OpenAI API"
3. You should see a real AI-generated review

## Alternative: Quick Workaround

If you need it working immediately without the Netlify setup, we can:
1. Create a temporary proxy service
2. Use a different API provider
3. Embed the key (less secure but works)

## Verification

The function IS deployed correctly at:
```
https://domes-reviews.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/generate-review
```

It's just missing the API key environment variable.

## Current Behavior

- ‚úÖ Function is deployed
- ‚úÖ Function is accessible
- ‚ùå API key not configured
- ‚ùå Falls back to template reviews

Once you add the API key in Netlify, everything will work!
