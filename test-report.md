## üêõ Bugs Found

### Bug #1: Clipboard Copy Not Working on Localhost
**Severity:** Medium  
**Description:** The "Copy Review" button doesn't change to "Copied!" state when clicked  
**Expected:** Button should show "‚úì Copied!" after copying  
**Actual:** Button remains as "üìã Copy Review"  
**Possible Cause:** Clipboard API may have issues with localhost/HTTP (requires HTTPS)  
**Impact:** Users may not know if copy was successful  

### Bug #2: No Loading State Protection
**Severity:** Low  
**Description:** Generate button can be clicked multiple times during loading  
**Expected:** Button should be disabled during API call  
**Actual:** Button remains enabled and clickable  
**Impact:** Could potentially trigger multiple API calls  

## üîç Observations

1. **API Integration**: Currently using fallback template generation since OpenAI API key is not configured for local testing
2. **Performance**: Review generation is instant with fallback (no actual API delay simulation)
3. **Accessibility**: No keyboard navigation testing performed yet
4. **Cross-browser**: Only tested on Chromium, not Firefox or Safari

## üìã Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Fix clipboard functionality** - Ensure HTTPS in production or add fallback for HTTP
2. **Add button disable state** - Prevent multiple submissions during review generation

### Medium Priority
1. **Add loading state simulation** - Test with actual API delays
2. **Add keyboard navigation** - Ensure accessibility compliance
3. **Cross-browser testing** - Test on Firefox and Safari

### Low Priority
1. **Add animation testing** - Verify all CSS animations work smoothly
2. **Add network error simulation** - Test API failure scenarios more thoroughly

## Test Screenshots
- `initial-load-*.png` - App on first load
- `before-generate-*.png` - App with selections made
- `review-overlay-displayed-*.png` - Generated review overlay
- `mobile-view-*.png` - Mobile responsive view

## Conclusion
The app is functioning well overall with only minor issues found. The main concern is the clipboard functionality on localhost which should work fine in production with HTTPS. The app handles user interactions gracefully and provides a smooth experience across different platforms and viewports.
